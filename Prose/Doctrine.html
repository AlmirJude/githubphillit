    <h1>Doctrina Christiana</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">by: Fray Juan de Plasencia and Fray Diego de Oropesa.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Doctrina Christiana (1593) is a significant historical work as it is the first book printed in the Philippines. It was written by Spanish missionaries, primarily Fray Juan de Plasencia, Fray Diego de Oropesa, and other religious figures, with the goal of teaching the Christian faith to the indigenous Filipino population. The book contains teachings about Christianity, including prayers, catechism, and basic doctrines, written in both Spanish and Tagalog.
        <br><br>The Doctrina Christiana aimed to introduce the core concepts of Catholicism, such as the Ten Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Articles of Faith. It also provided instructions on how to live a righteous life according to Christian teachings. The book was essential in the early stages of the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines, serving not just as a religious text but also as a tool for evangelizing the native population and converting them to Christianity.
        <br><br>Though the Doctrina Christiana was mostly instructional in nature, it also contained illustrations to help the largely illiterate population understand the concepts of Christianity. It became an important part of the Catholic missionary efforts, marking the beginning of the widespread spread of Christianity across the archipelago.
