    <h1>Ilustrado</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">by: Miguel Syjuco </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Ilustrado (2008) is a novel by Miguel Syjuco, a Filipino writer and journalist. The book is a multilayered, complex narrative that explores the life of Crisostomo Ibarra, a fictional character who was inspired by José Rizal's iconic character in Noli Me Tangere. The story centers around Miguel Syjuco, a writer who returns to the Philippines after studying abroad, and begins investigating the mysterious death of his mentor, Raymundo "Mundo" Cruz, a renowned Filipino author.
        <br><br>Through a combination of journal entries, letters, fictional essays, and excerpts from Ibarra's unfinished manuscript, the novel weaves together past and present, blurring the lines between reality and fiction. As Miguel delves deeper into the life of his mentor, he uncovers the dark realities of the Filipino elite, the struggles of Filipino identity, and the complexities of post-colonial life in the Philippines.
        <br><br>The novel is a sharp critique of Philippine society, focusing on the tensions between the privileged class (the ilustrados) and the marginalized masses, as well as the corruption, hypocrisy, and issues surrounding national identity. It is both a literary mystery and a social commentary on the Philippines’ political and cultural struggles.
