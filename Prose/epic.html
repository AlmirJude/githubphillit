    <h1>Biag ni Lam-Ang</h1>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Biag ni Lam-Ang (The Life of Lam-Ang) is a pre-colonial epic poem from the Ilocos region of the Philippines that tells the story of Lam-Ang, a hero with extraordinary powers and abilities. The epic begins before Lam-Ang is born. His father, Don Juan, leaves their home to fight their enemies, the Igorots, who live in the mountains. Don Juan does not return, and his wife, Namongan, gives birth to Lam-Ang alone. To everyone's amazement, Lam-Ang is no ordinary child. At birth, he could already speak and was highly intelligent. Upon learning that his father never came back, Lam-Ang vowed to seek revenge on the people who had killed him.
        <br><br>Even as a young boy, Lam-Ang showed incredible strength and courage. He set off alone on a dangerous journey to the mountains to face the Igorots. Along the way, Lam-Ang faced several obstacles, but he defeated them using his extraordinary powers and wit. When he reached the Igorot stronghold, Lam-Ang fought bravely and defeated all his enemies, including the ones who had killed his father. Victorious, Lam-Ang returned home to his mother, bringing honor to their family.
        <br><br>After avenging his father’s death, Lam-Ang heard stories about a beautiful woman named Ines Kannoyan, who lived in the town of Kalanutian. Smitten by her beauty and reputation, Lam-Ang decided to court her. However, the journey to Ines’s home was not easy. Many suitors had tried and failed to win her heart, as Ines came from a wealthy and well-respected family. Determined to win her, Lam-Ang brought impressive gifts, including gold and jewels, which amazed Ines and her family. He also proved his bravery and worth by completing challenges and defeating rivals who tried to prevent him from marrying Ines. His incredible feats and confidence won over Ines, and they were soon married in a grand ceremony celebrated by both their families and townspeople.
        <br><br>However, Lam-Ang’s journey did not end there. After their wedding, Lam-Ang had to fulfill a traditional custom that required him to dive into the sea to catch a rare fish. Despite his bravery, tragedy struck when Lam-Ang was swallowed by a giant fish. The townspeople believed Lam-Ang was dead, and Ines was left grieving.
        <br><br>But Lam-Ang's loyal magical pets — a rooster and a dog — refused to give up. The rooster crowed loudly, and the dog barked, summoning the magical powers that brought Lam-Ang back to life. The giant fish was caught, and Lam-Ang was freed and restored to his full strength. His revival brought great joy to Ines, his family, and the villagers. Lam-Ang and Ines lived happily together, and Lam-Ang’s courage, loyalty, and love were celebrated throughout the land.
        <br><br>The epic of Lam-Ang became a timeless tale of heroism, resilience, and devotion, passed down through generations as part of Filipino cultural heritage.
