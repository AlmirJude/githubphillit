    <h1>The Lover's Death</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">by Ricardo Demetillo</p>

    <pre>
He who had lived the earth with a firm love
Is now, being infirm, laid in the earth
That covers him with green grass quietly.
Once when he walked the fields, he suddenly knelt
And with an avid gesture clasped the earth.
His sun-lit fingers sifted dust.

Lovers would write their incoherent view
On passionate pages; but he, on pads of meadow,
Wrote with his plow a tongue-tied love.
Fields understood, for when the harvest ripened,
Fruits lay like brown breast for his hands to pluck,
And he with lightness, touched each pregnant stalk.

His house was quiet, like the man who closed
The gate behind him when the lamp light glowed.
He knew no woman's touch except the earth's.
We thought it fitting that the sun should touch
With quiet fingers the rice-fronds in the field
When he, after a fever, gave himself to dusk.

We could not salvage breath, but we could swathe
His body and lay it in the earth he loved.
He may return and beckon from a sheaf.
His body and lay it in the earth he loved
He may return and beckon from a sheaf

    <h3>Symbolism</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Love for the Earth:
          <ul>
            <li><p>The speaker begins by describing the man as someone who "had lived the earth with a firm love," emphasizing that his life was grounded in a deep connection to nature. His love was not romantic in the typical sense, but rather a profound bond with the earth itself, symbolized by his relationship with the fields and the crops.</p></li>
            <li><p>The man's act of kneeling and clasping the earth is a symbol of reverence and respect, not only for the land but for the natural processes that sustain life. His "sun-lit fingers sifted dust," which suggests an intimate relationship with the soil, further reinforcing the idea of the earth as a lover or partner.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Work and Simplicity:
          <ul>
            <li><p>The speaker describes how the man worked the land, "writing with his plow a tongue-tied love." This metaphor illustrates how the man expressed his love for life and the earth through his labor, which is simple yet profound. Unlike others who express their love through passionate words or romantic gestures, this man communicates through the act of working the land, planting, and harvesting.</p></li>
            <li><p>The man’s house is described as "quiet", symbolizing a life free from distractions, with no "woman's touch except the earth's." This suggests that his entire existence was centered around the earth and his work, making the earth his true companion.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Death and Legacy:
          <ul>
            <li><p>The man eventually succumbs to a fever and dies. The community swathes his body and places it in the earth he loved. The poem portrays his death as a return to the earth, which he had always considered his true home.</p></li>
            <li><p>The final image of the man "returning and beckoning from a sheaf" suggests that his spirit or essence lives on through the harvest. This echoes the idea of rebirth in nature, as the earth that nourished him will now nourish others, creating a cyclical relationship between life, death, and the land.</p></li>
