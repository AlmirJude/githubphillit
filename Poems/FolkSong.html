    <PRE>
Leron Leron sinta
Buko ng papaya
Dala-dala'y buslo
Sisidlan ng sinta
Pagdating sa dulo'y
Nabali ang sanga
Kapos kapalaran
Humanap ng iba

Gumising ka Neneng
Tayo'y manampalok
Dalhin mo ang buslo
Sisidlan ng hinog
Pagdating sa dulo'y
Lalamba-lambayog
Kumapit ka Neneng
Baka ka mahulog

Ako'y ibigin mo
Lalaking matapang
Ang baril ko'y pito
Ang sundang ko'y siyam
Ang lalakarin ko'y
Parte ng dinulang
Isang pinggang pansit
Ang aking kalaban
