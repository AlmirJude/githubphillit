    Santang Buds
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">by Alfonso P. Santos</p>

    <pre>
Let me see in dreams the santang buds
That in my absence blossom still beside
My window, Crimson buds, like crimson pearls
Ever faithfulness they bloom, unchanged,
Unfailing like the memories of home.

Now is the time, the season of their blooming,
An hour less, an hour more, yet stays
Their crimson evermore unchanged, untouched.
Let me but see in dreams the santang buds
That in my absence blooms, in faith for one.

Heart lost in foreign lands, fated to share
No love, no fortune from the world but born
To suffer want and misery, decreed
To live unknown, in penitence and need.

        <li>Santang Buds:
          <ul>
            <li><p>The "santang buds" are a central symbol in the poem. The image of the buds blooming in the speaker’s absence reflects the idea of something beautiful and enduring, despite distance or time. The "crimson buds" could symbolize love, passion, and deep emotional ties. The color crimson suggests something precious and full of life, while "like crimson pearls" intensifies the significance of these buds, symbolizing the beauty and value of the speaker’s memories of home.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Unchanging Nature of the Buds:
          <ul>
            <li><p>The buds are described as "unchanged, unfailing," representing the stability of the speaker’s love and memories. Regardless of time, represented by the "an hour less, an hour more," the buds remain "unchanged"—an image that contrasts with the speaker’s own emotional fluctuations due to his separation from home. The buds’ persistence serves as a symbol of hope and steadfastness.</p></li>
          </ul>

        <li>Absence and Longing:
          <ul>
            <li><p>The speaker expresses a deep desire to see the buds in dreams—a longing for connection to something that remains unchanged, even though the speaker is far away from it.

        <li>Foreign Land and Suffering:

He is fated to live in a foreign place, far from the love and fortune that he might have had in his home, where he feels both unknown and forgotten. This evokes the pain of displacement and the emotional burden of living without the comforts of home.</p></li>
